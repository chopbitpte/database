##### **Invoke NATO Article 5 against China for the deliberate ignorance of COVID-19 and stalling the WHO in the early days of the outbreak**

Petition to the UK government

*11 Apr 2022*

某國於武肺疫症初期故意封鎖消息及隱瞞疫情造成新冠武肺大爆發，令英國至今成千上萬人死亡。

該生化襲擊應視為對英國本土所發動之戰爭行為，因此英國政府須啟動北約共同防衛條款以及對相關國家索償。

Take actions against the People's Republic of China for the **deliberate ignorance and stalling the WHO** which aimed to *cover up* and *deceive* a deadly coronavirus outbreak at Wuhan China as reported by whistleblower **Dr Li Wenliang** who warned about the danger of human transmissions dated as early as December 2019 *(see evidence below)*.

Considering China's reputation as a powerful surveillance state known for the ability to swiftly detect and relentlessly neutralise any threat, the fact that Chinese authorities **failed** to *react to the outbreak and the possible human transmissions as of December 2019* is absolutely outrageous. The only logical explanation would be the **weaponisation of deliberate ignorance** aimed to *cover up* and *deceive* a deadly coronavirus outbreak at Wuhan, China.

Moreover China only informed the World Health Organisation about the virus on 31 December 2019, and in early January 2020, as the virus spread in Hubei province, the WHO asked China to hand over the genetic map of the virus and detailed patient data. But it took until 12 January for China to hand over the genetic sequence, and two more weeks to hand over patient data. There is no doubt China has been **stalling the WHO and covering up the outbreak** in its early days.

As a result of China’s **deliberate ignorance** and **stalling the WHO**, the *regional outbreak* transformed into a *global pandemic* known as **COVID-19** which has been claiming almost 200,000 innocent British lives for more than 2 years of which the very nature could only be an **intended biological attack** against the United Kingdom.

The British people demand justice. The UK government should **invoke NATO Article 5** and report such attack to the **Security Council** for further actions. Also the Prime Minister must take any measures necessary to protect the safety and security of the British people.
