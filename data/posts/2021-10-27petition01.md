##### **國際線任務：1. 取消中國的發展中國家地位及一切相關優惠政策**

2021-10-27

作為發展中國家，中國一直受惠於無數<a href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/devel_e/dev_special_differential_provisions_e.htm" target="_blank">經濟優惠政策</a>。中國不但濫用其優勢對其他國家進行不公平競爭，並運用舉國經濟力量肆無忌憚地壓迫鄰近國家。

而且中國人權狀況一直欠佳，世界各國多年來都持觀望態度而少有作為。只因大家當初錯誤地認為只要中國的經濟改善及中產階級冒起則會推動社會的民主化進程。但是中共執迷不悟，和平演變之路現在已兇多吉少。

可惜是世界對中國一廂情願的好意，不但沒有喚醒中國人民對自由民主的期盼，更燃點了中共對稱霸世界的雄心壯志。

為此，應馬上取消中國的發展中國家地位及一切相關優惠政策。

唔該 share 畀外國手足:

China has long been using trade as an instrument to bring other countries into submission. Due to the fact that China is the second largest economy in the world and has been weaponizing trade relentlessly, the international community should no longer treat China as a developing country.

Australia, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and countless other nations have all experienced the unparalleled economic pressure from China. If left unchecked, China can dominate the entire Western Pacific region through unfair trade practices and put the free world under total control.

For decades, China has been violating human rights and the rest of the world has done too little. Everyone had been deceived to believe China would gradually transform into a democratic regime, given the economic boom and an emerging middle class population. Sadly the long expected democratic transition never happened. Instead, the world has only made China more powerful and dangerous. Everyone must act now before China becomes unstoppable.

The world must renounce the developing country status of the People's Republic of China and revoke any provisions and agreements which granted the country with <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/devel_e/dev_special_differential_provisions_e.htm" target="_blank">beneficial terms and special treatments</a>. The international community must investigate China's policy which takes advantage of trade and investment as means to punish other countries that fail to conform with the totalitarian regime.

促请西方列强停止一切以诋毁中国经济及贬低我国发展水平为目标的歧视性经济政策，尊重中华人民共和国的经济实力及发展成就，并承认中国特色社会主义制度的优越性。
